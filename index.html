      <h3>Introducing ReelBooster</h3>
      <h4>
        A revolutionary startup giving creatives and audiences the power to
        shape the future of the entertainment industry
      </h4>

      <p>
        Amidst the Hollywood protests, where writers from WGA and actors from
        SAG-AFTRA are fighting for equitable compensation, especially in the
        uncertainty and disruption brought about by new advances in AI, the
        entertainment industry stands at a critical juncture. The rise of
        streaming services has resulted in reduced compensation for creatives,
        who previously relied on residuals from box-office earnings and the
        protection of their rights, including ownership of their likenesses. All
        of these income streams are now at risk. Furthermore, the studio system
        has become risk averse, resorting to recycling existing IPs and
        generating lacklustre content, which has left audiences underwhelmed and
        sent revenues plummeting. Now more than ever people crave fresh and
        original experiences, which the studios are largely failing to deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this, a groundbreaking startup has emerged to challenge the
        status quo and inject new life into the film industry. ReelBooster is a
        revolutionary platform on a mission to empower talented filmmakers who
        would normally be ignored by large studios and streaming platforms, to
        share their stories. ReelBooster aims to achieve this by offering
        innovative funding models and fostering stronger connections with
        targeted audiences. In turn, audiences can take a more proactive role in
        bringing their desired films to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        ReelBooster harnesses recent breakthroughs in the tech space,
        particularly AI and Web3 (blockchain with decentralised ownership),
        reducing the need to rely on traditional industry gatekeepers whose
        profit-driven motives may not prioritise the interests of creatives and
        audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reelbooster was founded by Carl Peterken, a seasoned tech industry
        veteran and filmmaker with over two decades of experience building
        engaging solutions for many organisations across the globe. Hailing from
        New Zealand, he now spends his time between London & Los Angeles. Carl
        has been involved in many innovative ventures, including the AI/web3
        metaverse company Futureverse (through Altered State Machine, which
        includes partnerships with Fifa & Muhammad Ali). He also led the
        front-end engineering team behind NZ's much-lauded Covid response,
        producing the Covid Tracer app. Using technology to take an active role
        in saving lives was one of his most defining achievements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carl builds products that solve real-world problems. His passion for
        both technology and film has driven him to found this startup.
        Underpinning it all is his immense desire to unlock the enormous
        creative potential in others.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Recent breakthroughs in the web3/blockchain space have shown us its
        power to reduce inequality in many industries - through giving more
        leverage to creators, not gatekeepers. With this technology, smart
        contracts can be used to provide more transparency, filmmakers can now
        incorporate royalty models directly, diminishing reliance on studio
        accounting practices that have been questionable. By offering audiences
        and investors part ownership in the produced intellectual property
        through smart contracts, filmmakers can grant exclusive access, elicit
        early feedback, and even grant voting rights through DAOs. These perks
        will allow filmmakers to raise funds more quickly for their endeavours,
        while allowing audiences to also help shape the destiny of these
        creations.”
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote></blockquote>“Can’t find any interesting content from the other streaming services?
      Imagine helping greenlight the projects you want to see from the comfort
      of your sofa and a Smart TV remote. Imagine a future where the next Star
      Wars is owned by the fans rather than a corporate entity?”
    </blockquote><blockquote>
      “If AI is used
      correctly, it can enhance the creative process - not take away from it.
      What differentiates humans from machines is our empathy and desire to tell
      an engaging, compelling story. AI is merely a tool so we don’t have to do
      all the heavy lifting ourselves and in turn it can actually help speed-up
      creativity.”
    </blockquote>
